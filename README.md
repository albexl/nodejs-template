# nodejs-template

Template for `Node.js` projects.

The main goal is to create a sufficiently reusable template for starting new `Node`.js projects. It would be great if it could be used so that the user only has to define the specific `models`, `controllers`, `services` and `routes` of the new project. For this purpose, generic `Controller` and `Service` classes are created, permitting to take a layered approach with no effort.
