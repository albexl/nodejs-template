# nodejs-template

Template for node js projects.

The main goal is to create a sufficiently reusable template for starting new node js projects. It would be great if it could be used so that the user only has to define the specific models, controllers, services and routes of the new project. For this purpose, generic Controller and Service classes are created, permitting to take a layered approach with no effort.

Another important features could be swagger documentation of endpoints, user authentication mechanism, authorization middleware, among others...
